## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

To run the project locally: clone -> npm i -> npm start

## Description
The project is based on the requierements from this link https://github.com/skhlilydotan/long-list-form-react-challenge-project.
In the user's page: The list includes, name, email, phone number and country. Every value can be introduced manually except from country that has to be selected from a list. 
New users can be added to the list and users can be deleted as well. Every value can be edited. Some of the values need to validated. Otherwise, "an error" will be identified in in the specific field and it will be summarized in the buttom of the table. 
In the statisctics page, country statistics are calculated automatically upon the introduction of every new user and changes made in the table, and shown graphically in a pie chart that describes the distributions of the users based on the country. 

React window library was chosen  for this project in order to improve the performance, UI and UX.
